## Abstract

This study presents a novel methodology to analyze local frustration patterns within protein families. This approach allows us to uncover constraints related to stability and function, and identify differential frustration patterns in families with a common ancestry. We have applied this methodology to a variety of well-studied cases such as PDZ, SH3, α and β globins, and RAS families. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of our approach to enhance our understanding of the natural phenotypic diversity of protein families beyond single protein instances through a proteome-wide analysis on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
